# Divide-and-Conquer

ðŸ§  How It Works:
- The array is recursively divided into halves until each sub-array has one element...
- Then, the sub-arrays are merged back together in sorted order...
Merge Sort is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n) and is a great example of how Divide and Conquer can be applied...
